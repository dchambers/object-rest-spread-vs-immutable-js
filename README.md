The tests within this repo (runnable with `npm test`) seek to compare the performance differences between modifying a large tree of object data using the object rest/spread operator Vs using Immutable.js. My findings so far have come to the topsy turvy conclusion that object rest/spread is always faster, which intuitively seems wrong, so something may be
amiss.
